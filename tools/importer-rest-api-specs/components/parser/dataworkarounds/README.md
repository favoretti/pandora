## Swagger Data Workarounds

This package provides temporary Swagger Data Workarounds whilst the source data is being corrected within [the `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).

Whilst this approach isn't ideal, since each workaround must be accompanied by a Pull Request to fix the incorrect data upstream, we believe this is a pragmatic solution to both unblock us in the short-term and fix the source data to enable quality improvements in the medium/long-term.
